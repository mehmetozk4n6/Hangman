# HANGMAN
In And Out is a game somewhat similar to Hangman, but with a very interesting twist. At the beginning of the game, a hidden word is chosen. The play starts with the IN mode. The player guesses a letter. If the player guesses correctly, the letter is revealed in the hidden word and he / she can guess another letter that has not been used in the IN mode before. The game continues like this until the player guesses a letter which is not in the word or the letter which has been guessed before in the IN mode. At this point, the play turns into the OUT mode and the player is required to guess a letter which he / she thinks is NOT in the word and has not been used in OUT mode before. If the player is incorrect, the mode stays in the OUT mode, and he / she loses points each time he / she guesses incorrectly. Once the player guesses a letter which is not in the word and has not been guessed in the OUT mode before, the play turns into the IN mode again, and the player can resume guessing letters he / she thinks are in the word. The player has 5 guess chances to guess the word incorrectly or guess the already used letters in modes. If the player finds the word before 5 chances are used, he / she becomes the winner. But if the player canâ€™t find the word before making 5 incorrect guesses, he / she becomes the loser.
